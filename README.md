# Project Happy Thoughts API

Create an API to be used with my previus frontend project "Happy Thoughts" deploy it on Google cloud and deploy the database on Atlas. 

## The problem

The API needs 2 different routes to be able to post a new thought, get the thoughts and like a thought.
The structure of my API was a little bit different then the API we first used. This was solved by comparing the the two and understanding were to moodify the fetch in the frontend.
I learned how to add validations for the data posted to make sure to only store valid data in the database
